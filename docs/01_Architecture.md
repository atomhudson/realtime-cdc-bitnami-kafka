# Real-Time Data Synchronization Architecture using Debezium CDC, MySQL, Kafka, and ClickHouse

## Overview
### What is Change Data Capture?
CDC is a process that allows organizations to automatically identify and capture database changes. It provides real-time data movements by continuously capturing and processing data as soon as a database event occurs. There are different methods of performing the CDC process, but basically we can divide it into the following two categories:

- **Log-based** (by tracking database transaction logs)
- **Query-based** (with Trigger, Timestamp, Snapshot)

A common and effective use is the use of database transaction logs. While other methods impose additional load on the database (such as requiring a regular query in the "timestamp" method), this is not the case when reading existing transaction logs.

### What is Debezium and where is it located in the CDC process?
Based on its most common usage, Debezium is a tool built on top of [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#gettingStarted) that provides a set of [Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect) compatible connectors. It transforms information in your existing databases into event streams, allowing applications to detect and instantly respond to row-level changes in databases. For this, [Debezium connectors](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/install.html) must be present in the Kafka Connect cluster.

If we briefly touch on Kafka Connect due to its important role here, it is a Kafka-dependent tool that provides data flow between Apache Kafka and other systems in a scalable and reliable way. It is possible to easily define and manage connectors to the Kafka Connect cluster via the REST API interface.

Debezium offers connectors for [Cassandra, Db2, MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle Database, Postgresql, SQL Server, Vitess databases](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/index.html). Additionally, it can be used as an embedded library in custom Java applications or as a completely standalone server.

### **Architecture Overview**
This architecture enables real-time Change Data Capture (CDC) using Debezium, Kafka, and ClickHouse. The key components include:
- **MySQL as the source database** – Stores transactional data.
- **Debezium as the CDC tool** – Captures changes from MySQL binlog ([Debezium Documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/)).
- **Kafka as the data streaming platform** – Transports change events to consumers ([Apache Kafka Guide](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)).
- **ClickHouse as the sink database** – Stores data for analytical processing.
- **Kafka Connectors** – Used for integrating the source (MySQL) and the sink (ClickHouse) ([Kafka Connect Docs](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html)).
- **Schema Registry** – Manages schema evolution for Kafka topics, ensuring compatibility between producers and consumers ([Schema Registry Overview](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html)).

### **Main Components**

#### **1. Source Connector (Debezium for MySQL)**
Debezium captures data changes from MySQL in real-time by monitoring its binary log (binlog). It converts these changes into structured events and publishes them to Kafka topics.

- **Types of Change Events:**
  - `CREATE` – When a new record is inserted.
  - `UPDATE` – When an existing record is modified.
  - `DELETE` – When a record is removed.
- **Event Structure:**
  - Includes before and after values for updates.
  - Contains metadata such as timestamps, transaction IDs, and source details.
  - More details on event formats can be found in the [Debezium Event Model](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/mysql.html#mysql-events-structure).

#### **2. Kafka as the Event Broker**
Kafka acts as the intermediary between the source (MySQL) and the sink (ClickHouse), ensuring efficient and scalable event-driven processing.

- **Kafka Topics:**
  - Change events from MySQL are categorized into Kafka topics.
  - Each table typically has its own Kafka topic.
  - Events are stored temporarily and can be consumed by multiple downstream applications.
- **Kafka Partitions:**
  - Improve scalability and performance.
  - Enable parallel processing by multiple consumers ([Kafka Partitioning Guide](https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/architecture/partitions/)).
- **Schema Registry:**
  - Ensures compatibility between message formats.
  - Prevents breaking changes in downstream consumers.

#### **3. Sink Connector (Kafka Connect for ClickHouse)**
A Kafka Connect sink connector reads messages from Kafka topics and inserts them into ClickHouse. This enables efficient real-time analytics and reporting.

- **Batch Processing:**
  - Messages can be processed in batches to optimize performance.
- **Schema Mapping:**
  - Defines how Kafka event fields are mapped to ClickHouse columns.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Configurable error tolerance for bad records ([Kafka Connect Error Handling](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/references/allconfigs.html#errors)).

### **End-to-End Data Flow**
1. **Data Changes in MySQL** → Inserts, updates, and deletes occur.
2. **Debezium Captures Changes** → Reads binlog and creates event messages.
3. **Kafka Streams Events** → Events are published to Kafka topics.
4. **Kafka Connect Moves Data to ClickHouse** → The sink connector consumes events and inserts them into ClickHouse.
5. **ClickHouse Processes and Aggregates Data** → Enables real-time reporting and analytics.
6. **Downstream Applications Consume Data** → Dashboards, reporting tools, and ML models use the processed data.

### **Challenges and Considerations**
- **Schema Evolution:** Ensure proper handling of schema changes in MySQL to avoid breaking downstream consumers ([Schema Evolution Best Practices](https://www.confluent.io/blog/schema-evolution-and-compatibility-in-apache-kafka/)).
- **Event Ordering:** Kafka partitions may cause out-of-order events; use timestamps or sequence IDs for proper reordering.
- **Throughput Optimization:** Tuning Kafka producer and consumer configurations can improve data ingestion speed ([Kafka Performance Tuning](https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/performance/)).
- **Failure Recovery:** Implement retries and dead-letter queues to handle failures gracefully ([Error Handling in Kafka](https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/build-applications/error-handling/)).

### **Benefits of This Architecture**
✅ **Decouples Source and Consumers** – Multiple applications can subscribe to changes without affecting the database.

✅ **Real-Time Processing** – No need for batch jobs or polling.

✅ **Scalability & Fault Tolerance** – Kafka ensures reliable event delivery.

✅ **Optimized for Analytics** – ClickHouse enables fast queries and aggregations.

✅ **Efficient Storage** – ClickHouse’s columnar storage format enhances performance for analytical queries.

✅ **Low Latency** – Ensures near real-time synchronization between MySQL and ClickHouse.

### **Conclusion**
This architecture provides a **scalable and efficient real-time data pipeline**, making it ideal for modern applications requiring **low-latency updates and real-time analytics**. With proper configurations, it enables **fault-tolerant, high-performance event-driven data processing** for various use cases, including **financial systems, e-commerce, and IoT analytics**.
